The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public Paint getPaint(double value) {
        double v = Math.max(value, this.lowerBound);
        v = Math.min(v, this.upperBound);
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);
        return new Color(g, g, g);
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
        int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound 
The code fails on this test:
org.jfree.chart.renderer.junit.GrayPaintScaleTests::testGetPaint
on this test line:
        c = (Color) gps.getPaint(-0.5);
with the following test error:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Color parameter outside of expected range: Red Green Blue
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.
