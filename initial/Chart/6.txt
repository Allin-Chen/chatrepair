The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {

        if (obj == this) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(obj instanceof ShapeList)) {
            return false;
        }
>>>[INFILL]<<<

    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
        return super.equals(obj);
The code fails on this test:
org.jfree.chart.util.junit.ShapeListTests::testSerialization
on this test line:
        assertEquals(l1, l2);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<org.jfree.chart.util.ShapeList@d1921e0b> but was:<org.jfree.chart.util.ShapeList@c949b0>
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.
