The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
>>>[INFILL]<<<
    private static int stringToWeek(String s) {

        int result = -1;
        s = s.replace('W', ' ');
        s = s.trim();
        try {
            result = Integer.parseInt(s);
            if ((result < 1) || (result > LAST_WEEK_IN_YEAR)) {
                result = -1;
            }
        }
        catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            // suppress
        }
        return result;

    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
        this(time, RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE, Locale.getDefault());
The code fails on this test:
org.jfree.data.time.junit.MonthTests::testParseMonth
on this test line:
        assertEquals(3, month.getMonth());
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<3> but was:<1>
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.
