The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
>>>[INFILL]<<<
        return toVersionInt(toJavaVersionIntArray(version, JAVA_VERSION_TRIM_SIZE));
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
    static float toJavaVersionInt(String version) {
The code fails on this test:
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt
on this test line:
        assertEquals(0, SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt(null));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<0> but was:<0.0>
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.
