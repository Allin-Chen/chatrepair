Here is an example of a repair job:
<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a bug:
    public static long safeMultiply(long val1, int val2) {
        switch (val2) {
            case -1:
>>>[INFILL]<<<

case -1:
    return -val1;
                return -val1;
            case 0:
                return 0L;
            case 1:
                return val1;
        }
        long total = val1 * val2;
        if (total / val2 != val1) {
          throw new ArithmeticException("Multiplication overflows a long: " + val1 + " * " + val2);
        }
        return total;
    }
The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.field.TestFieldUtils::testSafeMultiplyLongInt
on this test line:
            fail();
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the missing implementation for the case when `val2` is equal to -1. The switch statement is missing the necessary return statement when `val2` is -1, causing the function to not handle this case properly.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that when `val2` is -1, the function returns the result of multiplying `-1` with `val1`.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
case -1:
    return -val1;
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: duplicate case label
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "duplicate case label" indicates that the switch statement has multiple case labels with the same value, causing a conflict. In this case, the switch statement has two `case -1` labels, which is not allowed in Java switch statements.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should remove the duplicate `case -1` label and handle the multiplication when `val2` is -1 in a different way that does not lead to duplicate case labels.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
case -1:
    return -val1;
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: duplicate case label
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "duplicate case label" indicates that the switch statement has multiple case labels with the same value, causing a conflict. In this case, the switch statement has two `case -1` labels, which is not allowed in Java switch statements.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should remove the duplicate `case -1` label and handle the multiplication when `val2` is -1 separately from the switch statement in order to avoid the duplicate case labels issue.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if (val2 == -1) {
    return -val1;
}
```
