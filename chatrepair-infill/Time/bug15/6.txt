<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a bug:
    public static long safeMultiply(long val1, int val2) {
        switch (val2) {
            case -1:
>>>[INFILL]<<<

case -1:
    return -val1;
                return -val1;
            case 0:
                return 0L;
            case 1:
                return val1;
        }
        long total = val1 * val2;
        if (total / val2 != val1) {
          throw new ArithmeticException("Multiplication overflows a long: " + val1 + " * " + val2);
        }
        return total;
    }
The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.field.TestFieldUtils::testSafeMultiplyLongInt
on this test line:
            fail();
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the missing handling of the case when `val2` is 0 in the switch statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `val2` is 0.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should handle the case when `val2` is 0 to avoid any division by zero errors or unexpected behavior.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
case 0:
    return 0L;
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: duplicate case label
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "duplicate case label" occurs when there are multiple case labels with the same value in a switch statement. In this case, the case label for `-1` appears twice in the switch statement, causing the compilation error.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should remove the duplicate case label for `-1` to resolve the compilation error and ensure that each case value is unique within the switch statement.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
case -1:
    return -val1;
case 0:
    return 0L;
case 1:
    return val1;
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: duplicate case label
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "duplicate case label" indicates that there are multiple case labels with the same value in the switch statement. In this case, the case label for `-1` is repeated, causing the error to occur.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that each case label within the switch statement is unique to avoid compilation errors.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
            case -1:
                return -val1;
            case 0:
                return 0L;
            case 1:
                return val1;
```
