Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```

The following code contains a bug:
    public long computeMillis(boolean resetFields, String text) {
        SavedField[] savedFields = iSavedFields;
        int count = iSavedFieldsCount;
        if (iSavedFieldsShared) {
            iSavedFields = savedFields = (SavedField[])iSavedFields.clone();
            iSavedFieldsShared = false;
        }
        sort(savedFields, count);
        if (count > 0) {
            // alter base year for parsing if first field is month or day
            DurationField months = DurationFieldType.months().getField(iChrono);
            DurationField days = DurationFieldType.days().getField(iChrono);
            DurationField first = savedFields[0].iField.getDurationField();
            if (compareReverse(first, months) >= 0 && compareReverse(first, days) <= 0) {
                saveField(DateTimeFieldType.year(), iDefaultYear);
                return computeMillis(resetFields, text);
            }
        }

        long millis = iMillis;
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                millis = savedFields[i].set(millis, resetFields);
            }

        } catch (IllegalFieldValueException e) {
            if (text != null) {
                e.prependMessage("Cannot parse \"" + text + '"');
            }
            throw e;
        }
        
        if (iZone == null) {
            millis -= iOffset;
        } else {
            int offset = iZone.getOffsetFromLocal(millis);

            }
        }

The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.format.TestDateTimeFormatter::testParseLocalDate_weekyear_month_week_2010
on this test line:
        assertEquals(new LocalDate(2010, 1, 4, chrono), f.parseLocalDate("2010-01-01"));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<2010-01-04> but was:<2008-12-29>
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be related to the computation of millis in the provided code. The error message indicates that the expected date (2010-01-04) does not match the actual result (2008-12-29), which suggests that there might be a problem with setting the millis correctly. The bug may be related to how the millis are computed or set in the loop.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the millis are computed and set correctly in the loop to reflect the expected date (2010-01-04). This may involve checking the logic for setting millis in the loop to ensure it is consistent and accurate.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    try {
        millis = savedFields[i].set(millis, resetFields);
    } catch (IllegalFieldValueException e) {
        if (text != null) {
            e.prependMessage("Cannot parse \"" + text + '"');
        }
        throw e;
    }
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.It still does not fix the original test failure.
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be related to how the millis are computed and set in the loop. The incorrect handling of millis in the loop may be causing the discrepancy in the expected date (2010-01-04) and the actual result (2008-12-29). There may be a problem with how the savedFields are being processed or set in the loop, resulting in an incorrect date calculation.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the savedFields are processed and set correctly in the loop to accurately calculate the millis. The fix should address any issues in the loop logic that may be causing the date calculation to be incorrect, leading to the test failure.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
try {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        millis = savedFields[i].set(millis, resetFields);
    }
} catch (IllegalFieldValueException e) {
    if (text != null) {
        e.prependMessage("Cannot parse \"" + text + '"');
    }
    throw e;
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.It still does not fix the original test failure.
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue is likely related to how the savedFields are being processed and set in the loop. The incorrect handling of savedFields or how they are used to calculate the millis might be causing the discrepancy in the date calculation, leading to the test failure. There could be errors in how the set method is called on savedFields within the loop.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the savedFields are processed and set correctly in the loop to accurately calculate the millis. The fix should address any issues with how the set method is called on savedFields within the loop to avoid the incorrect date calculation.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
try {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        millis = savedFields[i].set(millis, resetFields);
    }
} catch (IllegalFieldValueException e) {
    if (text != null) {
        e.prependMessage("Cannot parse \"" + text + '"');
    }
    throw e;
}
```
