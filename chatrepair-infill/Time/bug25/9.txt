<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a bug:
    public int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {
        // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)
        final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);
        // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset
        final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
        final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);
        // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary
        if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
            // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap
            // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative
            if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
                // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed
                // back before the transition, whereas it should be
                // on or after the transition
                long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
                long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);
                if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
                    return offsetLocal;
                }
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
        }
        return offsetAdjusted;
    }
The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.TestDateTimeZoneCutover::test_DateTime_constructor_Moscow_Autumn
on this test line:
        assertEquals("2007-10-28T02:30:00.000+04:00", dt.toString());
with the following test error:
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected:<...10-28T02:30:00.000+0[4]:00> but was:<...10-28T02:30:00.000+0[3]:00>
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of the instantLocal when the offsets differ. The code is not handling the transition between standard time and daylight saving time correctly, resulting in an incorrect offset being returned.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the adjustment of the instantLocal takes into account the transition between standard time and daylight saving time accurately. This will ensure that the correct offset is returned for the given instantLocal.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
    long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
    long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetLocal);
    if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
        return offsetLocal;
    }
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.TestDateTimeZoneCutover::test_DateTime_constructor_Moscow_Autumn
on this test line:
        assertEquals("2007-10-28T02:30:00.000+04:00", dt.toString());
with the following test error:
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected:<...10-28T02:30:00.000+0[4]:00> but was:<...10-28T02:30:00.000+0[3]:00>
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The error seems to be related to the incorrect offset being returned in the case where the offsets differ due to a DST transition. The current fix does not accurately handle the DST boundary case, leading to incorrect offsets being returned.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the adjustment of the instantLocal considers the DST transition properly and returns the correct offset for the given instantLocal, especially near DST boundaries.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
    // Check if direct return of offsetAdjusted causes incorrect offset
    long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
    long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetLocal);
    if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
        return offsetAdjusted;
    }
} else {
    return offsetAdjusted;
}
``` 

This code change addresses the issue by properly handling the case where the offsets differ due to a DST boundary, ensuring that the correct offset is returned based on the DST transition.

The fixed version is still not correct.It still does not fix the original test failure.
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The test failure indicates that the offset being returned is still incorrect, specifically near the DST boundary. There seems to be a mistake in how the adjustment of the instantLocal is handled in relation to the offset calculations. The current fix is not accurately addressing the issue, leading to the incorrect offset being returned.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should accurately adjust the instantLocal and calculate the offset near the DST boundary to ensure that the correct offset is returned for the given instantLocal.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
    long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
    if (getOffset(instantAdjusted) == offsetAdjusted) {
        return offsetAdjusted;
    }
}
return offsetLocal;
```

This code change addresses the issue by adjusting the instantLocal correctly and comparing the calculated offset with the adjusted offset near the DST boundary, ensuring that the correct offset is returned based on the DST transition.
