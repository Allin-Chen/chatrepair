You are an Automated Program Repair Tool.
Here is an example of a repair job:
<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public double getSumSquaredErrors() {
>>>[INFILL]<<<
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
        return sumYY - sumXY * sumXY / sumXX;
The code fails on this test:
org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegressionTest::testSSENonNegative
on this test line:
        assertTrue(reg.getSumSquaredErrors() >= 0.0);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the fact that the `getSumSquaredErrors()` method is missing its implementation. The original buggy line that was removed calculates the sum of squared errors in a regression analysis, which is crucial for the correct functioning of the method. Without this calculation, the method cannot accurately return the sum of squared errors.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should implement the calculation for the sum of squared errors in the `getSumSquaredErrors()` method to ensure that it accurately calculates and returns the sum of squared errors in the regression analysis.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
public double getSumSquaredErrors() {
    return sumYY - sumXY * sumXY / sumXX;
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of expression
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "illegal start of expression" typically occurs when there is a syntax error in the code. In this case, it seems that the code snippet provided is incomplete or missing necessary syntax elements, leading to the compilation error. The `getSumSquaredErrors()` method is missing its method body, resulting in an incomplete implementation.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include the method body within the `getSumSquaredErrors()` method to define its behavior and allow the calculation of the sum of squared errors to be performed correctly. The method body should contain the necessary calculations for summing the squared errors based on the provided formula.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
public double getSumSquaredErrors() {
    // Calculate the sum of squared errors based on the provided formula
    double sumXX = calculateSumXX(); // assuming this is a method that calculates sumXX
    double sumXY = calculateSumXY(); // assuming this is a method that calculates sumXY
    double sumYY = calculateSumYY(); // assuming this is a method that calculates sumYY
    
    return sumYY - (sumXY * sumXY) / sumXX;
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of expression
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "illegal start of expression" indicates that there is a syntax error in the code that is preventing it from being compiled successfully. In this case, the code snippet provided is missing the necessary syntax elements or structure required for a valid Java method implementation. The code sample does not form a complete method implementation for `getSumSquaredErrors()`.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include a valid method implementation for `getSumSquaredErrors()` that includes the necessary syntax elements, such as method body, return type, and necessary calculations to compute the sum of squared errors. The method implementation should be complete and follow the correct Java syntax.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
public double getSumSquaredErrors() {
    // Perform necessary calculations to compute the sum of squared errors
    // Include the appropriate formulas or calculations here
    double sumXX = calculateSumXX();
    double sumXY = calculateSumXY();
    double sumYY = calculateSumYY();
    
    // Calculate the sum of squared errors using the provided formula
    return sumYY - (sumXY * sumXY) / sumXX;
}
``` 

You need to provide the actual formulas or calculations for `calculateSumXX()`, `calculateSumXY()`, and `calculateSumYY()` based on the context of your program in order to make this fix fully functional.
