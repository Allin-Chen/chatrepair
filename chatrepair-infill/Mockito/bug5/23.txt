<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public void verify(VerificationData data) {
        AssertionError error = null;

        timer.start();
        while (timer.isCounting()) {
            try {
                delegate.verify(data);

                if (returnOnSuccess) {
                    return;
                } else {
                    error = null;
                }
            } catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
        }

        if (error != null) {
            throw error;
        }
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
            catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
The code fails on this test:
org.mockitointegration.NoJUnitDependenciesTest::pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit
on this test line:
            checkDependency(classLoader_without_JUnit, pureMockitoAPIClass);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: 'org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl' has some dependency to JUnit
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be caused by a catch block that is catching a specific exception type (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent) which is not being handled properly. The error handling logic for this exception type is missing, leading to a failure in the test case.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should handle the exception type org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent appropriately to prevent the test failure. The error should be processed within the catch block for this exception to ensure proper error handling.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
    error = handleVerifyException(e);
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The error "illegal start of type" typically occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, such as incorrect placement of braces or incorrect Java syntax. In this case, the issue may be related to the structure of the catch block or incorrect usage of the exception type.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should address the syntax error in the catch block and properly handle the exception type org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent within the try-catch structure. The catch block should be well-formed and handle the exception appropriately.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
try {
    delegate.verify(data);

    if (returnOnSuccess) {
        return;
    } else {
        error = null;
    }
} catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
    error = handleVerifyException(e);
} catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
    error = handleVerifyException(e);
}
