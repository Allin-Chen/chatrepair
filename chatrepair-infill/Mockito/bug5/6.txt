<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public void verify(VerificationData data) {
        AssertionError error = null;

        timer.start();
        while (timer.isCounting()) {
            try {
                delegate.verify(data);

                if (returnOnSuccess) {
                    return;
                } else {
                    error = null;
                }
            } catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
        }

        if (error != null) {
            throw error;
        }
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
            catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
The code fails on this test:
org.mockitointegration.NoJUnitDependenciesTest::pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit
on this test line:
            checkDependency(classLoader_without_JUnit, pureMockitoAPIClass);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: 'org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl' has some dependency to JUnit
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the catch block trying to catch a specific exception type `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent`, which does not exist. This likely causes the code to ignore the `MockitoAssertionError` that is actually thrown, leading to unexpected behavior.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should catch the correct exception type `MockitoAssertionError` and handle it appropriately to avoid bypassing the error handling logic.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
    error = handleVerifyException(e);
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "illegal start of type" typically occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, such as mismatched braces or missing semicolons. In this case, the error may be due to the incorrect placement of the code block within the while loop.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the code block is placed correctly within the while loop so that it is a part of the loop's body.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
while (timer.isCounting()) {
    try {
        delegate.verify(data);

        if (returnOnSuccess) {
            return;
        } else {
            error = null;
        }
    } catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
        error = handleVerifyException(e);
    }
}
``` 

Please ensure that the code block provided above is placed correctly within the while loop structure to prevent any syntax errors and address the compilation issue.

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "illegal start of type" indicates that there is likely a syntax error in the code that is causing the compiler to interpret the code incorrectly. This error often occurs when there is a misplacement of code blocks or missing syntax elements.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should address the syntax error causing the "illegal start of type" compilation error. This will involve ensuring that the code structure is correct and all syntax elements are properly formatted.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
while (timer.isCounting()) {
    try {
        delegate.verify(data);

        if (returnOnSuccess) {
            return;
        } else {
            error = null;
        }
    } catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
        error = handleVerifyException(e);
    }
}
``` 

The provided code block should be correctly placed within the while loop structure to resolve the syntax error and compile successfully. It ensures that the try-catch block is part of the loop's body, preventing any "illegal start of type" errors.
