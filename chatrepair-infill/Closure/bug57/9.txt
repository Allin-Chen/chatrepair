<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
  private static String extractClassNameIfGoog(Node node, Node parent,
      String functionName){
    String className = null;
    if (NodeUtil.isExprCall(parent)) {
      Node callee = node.getFirstChild();
      if (callee != null && callee.getType() == Token.GETPROP) {
        String qualifiedName = callee.getQualifiedName();
        if (functionName.equals(qualifiedName)) {
          Node target = callee.getNext();
>>>[INFILL]<<<
            className = target.getString();
          }
        }
      }
    }
    return className;
  }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
          if (target != null) {
The code fails on this test:
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConventionTest::testRequire
on this test line:
    assertNotRequire("goog.require(foo)");
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Expected: <null> but was: foo
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be related to the handling of the target node `target` in the code. It appears that the condition `if (target != null)` is missing, which might lead to accessing a null reference and not setting the `className` variable correctly.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the `target` node is checked for null before accessing its properties to prevent any NullPointerExceptions.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if (target != null) {
    className = target.getString();
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "error: illegal start of type" indicates that there is a syntax issue in the code that is causing the compiler to not understand the structure of the code correctly. This typically happens when there is a misplaced or missing braces, semicolons, or other syntax elements.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should address the syntax issue by ensuring that the code structure is correct and follows the Java syntax rules.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
          if (functionName.equals(qualifiedName)) {
            Node target = callee.getNext();
            if (target != null) {
              className = target.getString();
            }
          }
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "error: illegal start of type" typically occurs when there is a syntax error in the Java code, such as a missing or misplaced brace, semicolon, or other syntax element. In this case, the error might be related to the structure of the code within the method.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should address the syntax error by ensuring that the code is properly structured within the method and follows Java syntax rules to compile successfully.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
          if (NodeUtil.isExprCall(parent)) {
            Node callee = node.getFirstChild();
            if (callee != null && callee.getType() == Token.GETPROP) {
              String qualifiedName = callee.getQualifiedName();
              if (functionName.equals(qualifiedName)) {
                Node target = callee.getNext();
                if (target != null) {
                  className = target.getString();
                }
              }
            }
          }
```
