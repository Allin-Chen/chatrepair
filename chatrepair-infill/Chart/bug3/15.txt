Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a bug:
    public TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end)
            throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        if (start < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Requires start >= 0.");
        }
        if (end < start) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Requires start <= end.");
        }
        TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();
>>>[INFILL]<<<
        copy.data = new java.util.ArrayList();
        if (this.data.size() > 0) {
            for (int index = start; index <= end; index++) {
                TimeSeriesDataItem item
                        = (TimeSeriesDataItem) this.data.get(index);
                TimeSeriesDataItem clone = (TimeSeriesDataItem) item.clone();
                try {
                    copy.add(clone);
                }
                catch (SeriesException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
        return copy;
    }
The code fails on this test:
org.jfree.data.time.junit.TimeSeriesTests::testCreateCopy3
on this test line:
        assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<101.0> but was:<102.0>
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be related to the data copy process within the `createCopy` method. The copy of the `TimeSeries` is being created, but the data within it is not being correctly copied from the original `TimeSeries`. This is leading to a discrepancy in the test result where the expected max Y value is 101.0 but the actual max Y value is 102.0. This indicates that there is a problem with the data copy process affecting the values in the `TimeSeries`.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the data within the `TimeSeries` copy is correctly copied from the original `TimeSeries`, maintaining the integrity of the data. This will ensure that the test results are consistent and accurate.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
copy.data = (ArrayList<TimeSeriesDataItem>) this.data.clone();
```

This fix will clone the data ArrayList of the original `TimeSeries` and assign it to the `data` field of the copied `TimeSeries`. This will ensure that the data is properly copied and maintained in the copied `TimeSeries`.

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: generics are not supported in -source 1.4
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error `error: generics are not supported in -source 1.4` indicates that the code is using generics, which are not supported in the specified Java source version (1.4). This means that the code is attempting to use a feature that is not compatible with the Java version being targeted. In this case, the use of generics with `<Type>` syntax is causing the compilation error.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should remove the use of generics from the code to make it compatible with the Java source version 1.4. This will ensure that the code can compile successfully without any issues related to unsupported features.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
copy.data = (ArrayList) this.data.clone();
```

By removing the generic type `<TimeSeriesDataItem>` from the cloning process, the code will no longer use generics and will be compatible with the Java source version 1.4. This change should resolve the compilation error related to unsupported generics and allow the code to compile successfully.

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: cannot find symbol
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error `error: cannot find symbol` indicates that the code is referencing a symbol that cannot be found in the current scope. In this case, it seems that there is an issue with the `java.util.ArrayList` being used without the proper import statement. The code is trying to create a new `ArrayList` without importing the necessary package, leading to the compilation error.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include the import statement for `java.util.ArrayList` to resolve the compilation error related to the missing symbol. By importing the required package, the code will be able to recognize and use the `ArrayList` class without any issues.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

// Infill location
copy.data = new ArrayList();
```

By adding the import statement `import java.util.ArrayList;` at the beginning of the file, the code will be able to recognize and use the `ArrayList` class without the `cannot find symbol` error. This fix should resolve the compilation error and allow the code to compile successfully.
