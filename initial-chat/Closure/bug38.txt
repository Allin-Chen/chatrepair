The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
  void addNumber(double x) {
    // This is not pretty printing. This is to prevent misparsing of x- -4 as
    // x--4 (which is a syntax error).
    char prev = getLastChar();
    boolean negativeZero = isNegativeZero(x);
>>>[INFILL]<<<
      add(" ");
    }

    if ((long) x == x && !negativeZero) {
      long value = (long) x;
      long mantissa = value;
      int exp = 0;
      if (Math.abs(x) >= 100) {
        while (mantissa / 10 * Math.pow(10, exp + 1) == value) {
          mantissa /= 10;
          exp++;
        }
      }
      if (exp > 2) {
        add(Long.toString(mantissa) + "E" + Integer.toString(exp));
      } else {
        add(Long.toString(value));
      }
    } else {
      add(String.valueOf(x));
    }
  }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
    if (x < 0 && prev == '-') {
The code fails on this test:
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testMinusNegativeZero
on this test line:
    assertPrint("x- -0", "x- -0.0");
with the following test error:
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected:<x-[ ]-0.0> but was:<x-[]-0.0>
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.

if (Character.isDigit(prev)) {
