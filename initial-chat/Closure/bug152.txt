The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
  JSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> scope) {
    setResolvedTypeInternal(this);

    call = (ArrowType) safeResolve(call, t, scope);
    prototype = (FunctionPrototypeType) safeResolve(prototype, t, scope);

    // Warning about typeOfThis if it doesn't resolve to an ObjectType
    // is handled further upstream.
    // TODO(nicksantos): Handle this correctly if we have a UnionType.
>>>[INFILL]<<<

    boolean changed = false;
    ImmutableList.Builder<ObjectType> resolvedInterfaces =
        ImmutableList.builder();
    for (ObjectType iface : implementedInterfaces) {
      ObjectType resolvedIface = (ObjectType) iface.resolve(t, scope);
      resolvedInterfaces.add(resolvedIface);
      changed |= (resolvedIface != iface);
    }
    if (changed) {
      implementedInterfaces = resolvedInterfaces.build();
    }

    if (subTypes != null) {
      for (int i = 0; i < subTypes.size(); i++) {
        subTypes.set(i, (FunctionType) subTypes.get(i).resolve(t, scope));
      }
    }

    return super.resolveInternal(t, scope);
  }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
    typeOfThis = (ObjectType) safeResolve(typeOfThis, t, scope);
The code fails on this test:
com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testBackwardsTypedefUse1
on this test line:
    testTypes(
        "/** @this {MyTypedef} */ function f() {}" +
        "/** @typedef {string} */ var MyTypedef;",
with the following test error:
java.lang.ClassCastException: com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.StringType cannot be cast to com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.

typeOfThis = safeResolve(typeOfThis, t, scope);
