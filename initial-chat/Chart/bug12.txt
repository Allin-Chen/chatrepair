The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
>>>[INFILL]<<<
    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream)
        throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        stream.defaultReadObject();
        this.aggregatedItemsPaint = SerialUtilities.readPaint(stream);
        this.sectionPaints = new HashMap();
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
        this.dataset = dataset;
The code fails on this test:
org.jfree.chart.plot.junit.MultiplePiePlotTests::testConstructor
on this test line:
    	assertTrue(dataset.hasListener(plot));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.

this.dataset = (MultiplePieDataset) dataset;
