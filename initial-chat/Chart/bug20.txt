The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
>>>[INFILL]<<<
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj == this) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!super.equals(obj)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!(obj instanceof ValueMarker)) {
            return false;
        }
        ValueMarker that = (ValueMarker) obj;
        if (this.value != that.value) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
        super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);
The code fails on this test:
org.jfree.chart.plot.junit.ValueMarkerTests::test1808376
on this test line:
        assertEquals(Color.blue, m.getOutlinePaint());
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<java.awt.Color[r=0,g=0,b=255]> but was:<java.awt.Color[r=255,g=0,b=0]>
Please provide the correct line at the infill location.

super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);
