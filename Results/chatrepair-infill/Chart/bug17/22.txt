The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
>>>[INFILL]<<<
        return clone;
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
        Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);
The code fails on this test:
org.jfree.data.time.junit.TimeSeriesTests::testBug1832432
on this test line:
            s2 = (TimeSeries) s1.clone();
with the following test error:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Requires start <= end.
It can be fixed by these possible patches:
plausible patch 1 :

Object clone = createCopy(0, Math.max(0, getItemCount() - 1));

plausible patch 2 :

Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() > 0 ? getItemCount() - 1 : 0);

plausible patch 3 :

Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() <= 1 ? 0 : getItemCount() - 1);

plausible patch 4 :

Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() <= 0 ? 0 : getItemCount() - 1);

plausible patch 5 :

Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() > 1 ? getItemCount() - 1 : 0);

Please generate an alternative patch in the form of Java Markdown code block.
```java
Object clone = createCopy(0, Math.max(getItemCount() - 1, 0));
```
