<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
  private static String extractClassNameIfGoog(Node node, Node parent,
      String functionName){
    String className = null;
    if (NodeUtil.isExprCall(parent)) {
      Node callee = node.getFirstChild();
      if (callee != null && callee.getType() == Token.GETPROP) {
        String qualifiedName = callee.getQualifiedName();
        if (functionName.equals(qualifiedName)) {
          Node target = callee.getNext();
>>>[INFILL]<<<
            className = target.getString();
          }
        }
      }
    }
    return className;
  }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
          if (target != null) {
The code fails on this test:
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConventionTest::testRequire
on this test line:
    assertNotRequire("goog.require(foo)");
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Expected: <null> but was: foo
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be that the variable `target` is not being checked for `null` before accessing its value to set `className`. This can lead to a NullPointerException if `target` is null, as seen in the failed test case. It is important to ensure that `target` is not null before attempting to access its value.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include a check for `target` being not null before assigning its value to `className`. This will prevent the NullPointerException and ensure the correct behavior of the code.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if (target != null) {
    className = target.getString();
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The error "illegal start of type" indicates that there may be a syntax issue in the code. In this context, it could be due to the incorrect placement of the code block or missing curly braces. It is important to ensure that the code is syntactically correct and follows Java syntax rules.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should address the syntax issue causing the "illegal start of type" error. This could involve adjusting the placement of the code block or ensuring that curly braces are properly used to define the scope of the code.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
      if (functionName.equals(qualifiedName)) {
          Node target = callee.getNext();
          if (target != null) {
              className = target.getString();
          }
      }
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The error "illegal start of type" typically occurs when there is a syntax error or misplaced code within a Java class or method. In this case, the error may be due to the incorrect placement of code or missing curly braces, which disrupt the syntax of the method. It's important to ensure that the structure of the code is correct to avoid compilation errors.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should address the syntax error causing the "illegal start of type" compilation error. By adjusting the placement of the code block and ensuring that the structure of the method is correct, the error can be resolved.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
  String className = null;
  if (NodeUtil.isExprCall(parent)) {
    Node callee = node.getFirstChild();
    if (callee != null && callee.getType() == Token.GETPROP) {
      String qualifiedName = callee.getQualifiedName();
      if (functionName.equals(qualifiedName)) {
        Node target = callee.getNext();
        if (target != null) {
          className = target.getString();
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return className;
```
