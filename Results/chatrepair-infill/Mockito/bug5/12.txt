<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public void verify(VerificationData data) {
        AssertionError error = null;

        timer.start();
        while (timer.isCounting()) {
            try {
                delegate.verify(data);

                if (returnOnSuccess) {
                    return;
                } else {
                    error = null;
                }
            } catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
        }

        if (error != null) {
            throw error;
        }
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
            catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
The code fails on this test:
org.mockitointegration.NoJUnitDependenciesTest::pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit
on this test line:
            checkDependency(classLoader_without_JUnit, pureMockitoAPIClass);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: 'org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl' has some dependency to JUnit
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from catching the wrong exception type `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent` instead of `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent`. This mismatch in exception handling can lead to the test failure.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should catch the correct exception type `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent` to handle the exception appropriately and prevent the test failure.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
```

The fixed version is still not correct.It still does not fix the original test failure.
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to be related to the handling of the exception `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent`. The test failure indicates that there is a dependency to JUnit that needs to be addressed. The current exception handling does not properly handle this situation, leading to the test failure.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should handle the `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent` exception appropriately and address any dependencies to JUnit that may be causing the test failure. 

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
    error = handleVerifyException(e);
}
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "illegal start of type" indicates that there might be a syntax error in the code that is preventing it from compiling correctly. This error could be due to a missing curly brace or a misplaced keyword.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should resolve the syntax error that is causing the compilation issue. It should ensure that the code structure is correct and follows Java syntax rules.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
} catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
    error = handleVerifyException(e);
}
```
