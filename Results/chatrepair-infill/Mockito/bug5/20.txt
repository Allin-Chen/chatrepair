<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public void verify(VerificationData data) {
        AssertionError error = null;

        timer.start();
        while (timer.isCounting()) {
            try {
                delegate.verify(data);

                if (returnOnSuccess) {
                    return;
                } else {
                    error = null;
                }
            } catch (MockitoAssertionError e) {
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                error = handleVerifyException(e);
            }
        }

        if (error != null) {
            throw error;
        }
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
            catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
The code fails on this test:
org.mockitointegration.NoJUnitDependenciesTest::pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit
on this test line:
            checkDependency(classLoader_without_JUnit, pureMockitoAPIClass);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: 'org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl' has some dependency to JUnit
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be caused by the catch block catching `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent` instead of `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent`. This leads to an incorrect handling of the exception, causing the test to fail.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the catch block catches the correct exception `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent` to handle the exception appropriately.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
```

The fixed version is still not correct.It still does not fix the original test failure.
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The error "org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl has some dependency to JUnit" indicates that there is a dependency on JUnit within the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class. This dependency is causing the test failure.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should remove the dependency on JUnit within the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class to ensure that the test can run without any dependencies on JUnit.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
```

The fixed version is still not correct.It still does not fix the original test failure.
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The error "org.mockito.internal.verification.VerificationOverTimeImpl has some dependency to JUnit" suggests that there is an unexpected dependency on JUnit within the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class. This dependency is causing the test failure, indicating that the class is not correctly isolated from JUnit dependencies.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should involve removing the dependency on JUnit from the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class. This can be achieved by ensuring that the class does not directly reference any JUnit-specific classes or methods, thereby making it independent of JUnit.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.junit.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {
```
