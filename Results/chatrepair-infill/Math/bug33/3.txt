Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```

The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    protected void dropPhase1Objective() {
        if (getNumObjectiveFunctions() == 1) {
            return;
        }

        List<Integer> columnsToDrop = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        columnsToDrop.add(0);

        // positive cost non-artificial variables
        for (int i = getNumObjectiveFunctions(); i < getArtificialVariableOffset(); i++) {
            final double entry = tableau.getEntry(0, i);
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                columnsToDrop.add(i);
            }
        }

        // non-basic artificial variables
        for (int i = 0; i < getNumArtificialVariables(); i++) {
          int col = i + getArtificialVariableOffset();
          if (getBasicRow(col) == null) {
            columnsToDrop.add(col);
          }
        }

        double[][] matrix = new double[getHeight() - 1][getWidth() - columnsToDrop.size()];
        for (int i = 1; i < getHeight(); i++) {
          int col = 0;
          for (int j = 0; j < getWidth(); j++) {
            if (!columnsToDrop.contains(j)) {
              matrix[i - 1][col++] = tableau.getEntry(i, j);
            }
          }
        }

        for (int i = columnsToDrop.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          columnLabels.remove((int) columnsToDrop.get(i));
        }

        this.tableau = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(matrix);
        this.numArtificialVariables = 0;
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
            if (Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, maxUlps) > 0) {
The code fails on this test:
org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.linear.SimplexSolverTest::testMath781
on this test line:
        Assert.assertTrue(Precision.compareTo(solution.getPoint()[0], 0.0d, epsilon) > 0);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from an incomplete conditional statement that was removed at the infill location. The condition checks if the entry in the tableau is greater than 0. This condition is crucial for identifying positive cost non-artificial variables to be dropped during the computation.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include the missing condition to correctly identify and drop positive cost non-artificial variables from the computation.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:
```java
            if (Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, maxUlps) > 0) {
                columnsToDrop.add(i);
            }
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "illegal start of type" indicates that there might be a syntax error or misplaced code in the provided fix. The previous fix attempted to add the condition for dropping columns within the for loop, but it seems there might be a missing opening or closing brace causing this error.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should properly add the condition for dropping columns within the for loop without causing any compilation errors.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:
```java
        for (int i = getNumObjectiveFunctions(); i < getArtificialVariableOffset(); i++) {
            final double entry = tableau.getEntry(0, i);
            if (Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, maxUlps) > 0) {
                columnsToDrop.add(i);
            }
        }
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: illegal start of type
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "illegal start of type" suggests that there might be a structural issue with the provided fix. It is possible that the placement of braces or syntax might be incorrect, leading to this compilation error.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the code structure is correct and that there are no syntax errors causing compilation issues.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:
```java
        for (int i = getNumObjectiveFunctions(); i < getArtificialVariableOffset(); i++) {
            final double entry = tableau.getEntry(0, i);
            if (Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, maxUlps) > 0) {
                columnsToDrop.add(i);
            }
        }
```
