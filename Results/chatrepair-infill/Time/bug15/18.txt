<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a bug:
    public static long safeMultiply(long val1, int val2) {
        switch (val2) {
            case -1:
>>>[INFILL]<<<

case -1:
    return -val1;
                return -val1;
            case 0:
                return 0L;
            case 1:
                return val1;
        }
        long total = val1 * val2;
        if (total / val2 != val1) {
          throw new ArithmeticException("Multiplication overflows a long: " + val1 + " * " + val2);
        }
        return total;
    }
The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.field.TestFieldUtils::testSafeMultiplyLongInt
on this test line:
            fail();
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the missing implementation for the case when `val2` is equal to -1. The existing case handling does not cover this scenario, resulting in an incomplete switch statement.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include the implementation for the case when `val2` is equal to -1, returning the negative value of `val1`.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
case -1:
    return -val1;
```
This fix will ensure that when `val2` is equal to -1, the method will return the negative value of `val1`, as expected.

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: duplicate case label
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "duplicate case label" indicates that there are multiple case labels with the same value within the switch statement. In this case, the switch statement already has a case label for `val2` equal to -1, so adding another duplicate case label is causing the compilation error.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should handle the case when `val2` is equal to -1 without causing a duplicate case label in the switch statement.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
return -val1;
```
By removing the duplicate case label and directly returning the negative value of `val1` in the existing case label for `val2` equal to -1, the correct behavior will be achieved without causing the compilation error.

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: duplicate case label
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error "duplicate case label" indicates that there are multiple case labels with the same value within the switch statement. In this case, adding a new case label for -1 is redundant and causing the duplicate case label error.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should handle the case when `val2` is equal to -1 without introducing a duplicate case label in the switch statement.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
case 2:
    return val1 + val1;
```
By replacing the redundant case label for -1 with a new case label, such as 2, and returning a value based on that case, we can resolve the issue of duplicate case labels while still providing a correct behavior for the switch statement.
