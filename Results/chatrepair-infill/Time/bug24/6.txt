Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```

The following code contains a bug:
    public long computeMillis(boolean resetFields, String text) {
        SavedField[] savedFields = iSavedFields;
        int count = iSavedFieldsCount;
        if (iSavedFieldsShared) {
            iSavedFields = savedFields = (SavedField[])iSavedFields.clone();
            iSavedFieldsShared = false;
        }
        sort(savedFields, count);
        if (count > 0) {
            // alter base year for parsing if first field is month or day
            DurationField months = DurationFieldType.months().getField(iChrono);
            DurationField days = DurationFieldType.days().getField(iChrono);
            DurationField first = savedFields[0].iField.getDurationField();
            if (compareReverse(first, months) >= 0 && compareReverse(first, days) <= 0) {
                saveField(DateTimeFieldType.year(), iDefaultYear);
                return computeMillis(resetFields, text);
            }
        }

        long millis = iMillis;
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                millis = savedFields[i].set(millis, resetFields);
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
        } catch (IllegalFieldValueException e) {
            if (text != null) {
                e.prependMessage("Cannot parse \"" + text + '"');
            }
            throw e;
        }
        
        if (iZone == null) {
            millis -= iOffset;
        } else {
            int offset = iZone.getOffsetFromLocal(millis);
            millis -= offset;
            if (offset != iZone.getOffset(millis)) {
                String message =
                    "Illegal instant due to time zone offset transition (" + iZone + ')';
                if (text != null) {
                    message = "Cannot parse \"" + text + "\": " + message;
                }
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(message);
            }
        }
        
        return millis;
    }
The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.format.TestDateTimeFormatter::testParseLocalDate_weekyear_month_week_2010
on this test line:
        assertEquals(new LocalDate(2010, 1, 4, chrono), f.parseLocalDate("2010-01-01"));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<2010-01-04> but was:<2008-12-29>
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the millis in the `computeMillis` function. The buggy line at the `>>>[INFILL]<<<` location might be causing the incorrect calculation of the millis, leading to the test failure.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the calculation of millis in the loop is done correctly based on the saved fields, so that the resulting millis value is accurate and matches the expected output.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
millis = savedFields[i].set(millis, resetFields);
```

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: cannot find symbol
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error `cannot find symbol` indicates that the symbol `set` is not recognized in the context where it is being used. This suggests that there might be an issue with the type or scope of the method being called on `savedFields[i]`.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the method `set` can be properly accessed and utilized on the `savedFields[i]` object in the loop to compute the millis value correctly.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
millis = savedFields[i].iField.set(millis, resetFields);
``` 

This fix assumes that there is a field `iField` within the `SavedField` class which has a `set` method that can be called to compute the millis value accurately.

The fixed version is still not correct.Code has the following compilation error: error: cannot find symbol
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The compilation error `cannot find symbol` suggests that the compiler cannot find the symbol `set` in the context where it is being used. This indicates that the method `set` is not a member of the `savedFields[i]` object or its associated class.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should involve calling the appropriate method on the `savedFields[i]` object to modify the `millis` value based on the field it represents, so that the computation of `millis` is done correctly.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
millis = savedFields[i].getField().add(millis, savedFields[i].getValue(), resetFields);
```

This fix assumes that each `SavedField` object has a method `getField()` that returns the field type, a method `getValue()` that returns the value to be added to `millis`, and a method `add()` in the field type to compute the updated `millis` value.
