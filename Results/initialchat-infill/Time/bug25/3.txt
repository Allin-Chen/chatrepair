<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a bug:
    public int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {
        // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)
        final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);
        // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset
        final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
        final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);
        // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary
        if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
            // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap
            // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative
            if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
                // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed
                // back before the transition, whereas it should be
                // on or after the transition
                long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
                long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);
                if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
                    return offsetLocal;
                }
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
        }
        return offsetAdjusted;
    }
The code fails on this test:
org.joda.time.TestDateTimeZoneCutover::test_DateTime_constructor_Moscow_Autumn
on this test line:
        assertEquals("2007-10-28T02:30:00.000+04:00", dt.toString());
with the following test error:
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected:<...10-28T02:30:00.000+0[4]:00> but was:<...10-28T02:30:00.000+0[3]:00>
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct hunk at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the offset when near a Daylight Saving Time (DST) boundary. The offset is calculated based on the adjusted instant, but the comparison logic is not correctly handling the transition between standard time and DST.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the offset comparison logic correctly handles the transition between standard time and DST, and returns the appropriate offset for the given instant.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
return offsetAdjusted;
```
