Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```

The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    protected void dropPhase1Objective() {
        if (getNumObjectiveFunctions() == 1) {
            return;
        }

        List<Integer> columnsToDrop = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        columnsToDrop.add(0);

        // positive cost non-artificial variables
        for (int i = getNumObjectiveFunctions(); i < getArtificialVariableOffset(); i++) {
            final double entry = tableau.getEntry(0, i);
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                columnsToDrop.add(i);
            }
        }

        // non-basic artificial variables
        for (int i = 0; i < getNumArtificialVariables(); i++) {
          int col = i + getArtificialVariableOffset();
          if (getBasicRow(col) == null) {
            columnsToDrop.add(col);
          }
        }

        double[][] matrix = new double[getHeight() - 1][getWidth() - columnsToDrop.size()];
        for (int i = 1; i < getHeight(); i++) {
          int col = 0;
          for (int j = 0; j < getWidth(); j++) {
            if (!columnsToDrop.contains(j)) {
              matrix[i - 1][col++] = tableau.getEntry(i, j);
            }
          }
        }

        for (int i = columnsToDrop.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          columnLabels.remove((int) columnsToDrop.get(i));
        }

        this.tableau = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(matrix);
        this.numArtificialVariables = 0;
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
            if (Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, maxUlps) > 0) {
The code fails on this test:
org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.linear.SimplexSolverTest::testMath781
on this test line:
        Assert.assertTrue(Precision.compareTo(solution.getPoint()[0], 0.0d, epsilon) > 0);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to arise from a missing conditional statement in the code snippet. The removed line was responsible for checking if the entry value is greater than 0 before adding the column index to the list `columnsToDrop`. This condition is crucial to determine which columns should be dropped from further processing.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include the missing conditional statement to ensure that only the columns with positive cost non-artificial variables are added to the list `columnsToDrop`.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if (Precision.compareTo(entry, 0d, maxUlps) > 0) {
    columnsToDrop.add(i);
}
```
