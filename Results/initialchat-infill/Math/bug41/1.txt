Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```

The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public double evaluate(final double[] values, final double[] weights,
                           final double mean, final int begin, final int length) {

        double var = Double.NaN;

        if (test(values, weights, begin, length)) {
            if (length == 1) {
                var = 0.0;
            } else if (length > 1) {
                double accum = 0.0;
                double dev = 0.0;
                double accum2 = 0.0;
                for (int i = begin; i < begin + length; i++) {
                    dev = values[i] - mean;
                    accum += weights[i] * (dev * dev);
                    accum2 += weights[i] * dev;
                }

                double sumWts = 0;
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                    sumWts += weights[i];
                }

                if (isBiasCorrected) {
                    var = (accum - (accum2 * accum2 / sumWts)) / (sumWts - 1.0);
                } else {
                    var = (accum - (accum2 * accum2 / sumWts)) / sumWts;
                }
            }
        }
        return var;
    }

Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the calculation of the sum of weights `sumWts` inside the loop. The variable `i` is not defined within the loop, leading to an incorrect calculation of `sumWts`. The loop should iterate over the array indices within the given range `[begin, begin + length)` to correctly calculate the sum of weights.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the sum of weights `sumWts` is calculated correctly by iterating over the array indices within the specified range `[begin, begin + length)`.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
                for (int i = begin; i < begin + length; i++) {
                    sumWts += weights[i];
                }
```
