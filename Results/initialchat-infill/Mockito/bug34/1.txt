<Example start>
Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public void captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation i) {
        int k = 0;
        for (Matcher m : matchers) {
>>>[INFILL]<<<
                ((CapturesArguments) m).captureFrom(i.getArguments()[k]);
            }
            k++;
        }
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
            if (m instanceof CapturesArguments) {
The code fails on this test:
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcherTest::shouldMatchCaptureArgumentsWhenArgsCountDoesNOTMatch
on this test line:
        invocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom(invocation);
with the following test error:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to be caused by the use of unchecked casting to `CapturesArguments` without verifying the instance type. This leads to potential `ClassCastException` when trying to call the `captureFrom` method. The `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error suggests that the `getArguments()` array is empty or has fewer elements than expected.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the type casting is done safely by checking if the matcher instance is actually an instance of `CapturesArguments` before calling the `captureFrom` method. Additionally, there should be a check to ensure that the array of arguments is not empty before trying to access its elements.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if (m instanceof CapturesArguments) {
    if (i.getArguments().length > k) {
        ((CapturesArguments) m).captureFrom(i.getArguments()[k]);
    }
}
```
