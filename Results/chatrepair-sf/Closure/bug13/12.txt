The following code contains a bug:
  private void traverse(Node node) {
    // The goal here is to avoid retraversing
    // the entire AST to catch newly created opportunities.
    // So we track whether a "unit of code" has changed,
    // and revisit immediately.
    if (!shouldVisit(node)) {
      return;
    }

    int visits = 0;
    do {
      Node c = node.getFirstChild();
      while(c != null) {
        traverse(c);
        Node next = c.getNext();
        c = next;
      }

      visit(node);
      visits++;

      Preconditions.checkState(visits < 10000, "too many interations");
    } while (shouldRetraverse(node));

    exitNode(node);
  }
The code fails on this test:
com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue787
on this test line:
    test(options, code, result);
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError:
It can be fixed by these possible correct version:
Correct version 1 :

private void traverse(Node node) {
    // The goal here is to avoid retraversing
    // the entire AST to catch newly created opportunities.
    // So we track whether a "unit of code" has changed,
    // and revisit immediately.
    if (!shouldVisit(node)) {
        return;
    }

    int visits = 0;
    do {
        Node c = node.getFirstChild();
        while (c != null) {
            Node next = c.getNext(); // Update next node before traversing
            traverse(c);
            c = next; // Update current node to next node
        }

        visit(node);
        visits++;

        Preconditions.checkState(visits < 10000, "too many iterations");
    } while (shouldRetraverse(node));

    exitNode(node);
}

Please generate an alternative correct version of the function in the form of Java Markdown code block.
```java
private void traverse(Node node) {
    // The goal here is to avoid retraversing
    // the entire AST to catch newly created opportunities.
    // So we track whether a "unit of code" has changed,
    // and revisit immediately.
    if (!shouldVisit(node)) {
        return;
    }

    int visits = 0;
    boolean changed = false; // Track if any changes were made during traversal
    do {
        Node c = node.getFirstChild();
        while (c != null) {
            Node next = c.getNext(); // Update next node before traversing
            traverse(c);
            if (c.hasChanged()) {
                changed = true; // Mark that a change occurred in this subtree
            }
            c = next; // Update current node to next node
        }

        if (changed) { // Only visit if there was a change in the subtree
            visit(node);
        }
        visits++;

        Preconditions.checkState(visits < 10000, "too many iterations");
    } while (changed && shouldRetraverse(node));

    exitNode(node);
}
```
