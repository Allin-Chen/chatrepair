Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
    public int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {
        // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)
        final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);
        // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset
        final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
        final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);
        // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary
        if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
            // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap
            // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative
            if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
                // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed
                // back before the transition, whereas it should be
                // on or after the transition
                long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
                long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);
                if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
                    return offsetLocal;
                }
            }
>>>[INFILL]<<<
            long prev = previousTransition(instantAdjusted);
            if (prev < instantAdjusted) {
                int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev);
                int diff = offsetPrev - offsetLocal;
                if (instantAdjusted - prev <= diff) {
                    return offsetPrev;
                }
            }
        }
        return offsetAdjusted;
    }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location

Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The issue seems to arise from the missing condition for handling cases where `offsetLocal` is greater than 0. This condition is necessary to properly handle positive offsets in the logic flow of the code. Without this condition, the code may not handle positive offsets correctly near DST boundaries.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include a condition to handle cases where `offsetLocal` is greater than 0, to ensure proper handling of positive offsets near DST boundaries.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
        } else if (offsetLocal > 0) {
```
