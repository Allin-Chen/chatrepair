Example buggy function and request:
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed.
    public static boolean isSameLocalTime(Calendar cal1, Calendar cal2) {
        if (cal1 == null || cal2 == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The date must not be null");
        }
        return (cal1.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.MILLISECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.SECOND) == cal2.get(Calendar.SECOND) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.MINUTE) == cal2.get(Calendar.MINUTE) &&
                >>>[INFILL]<<<
                cal1.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.YEAR) == cal2.get(Calendar.YEAR) &&
                cal1.get(Calendar.ERA) == cal2.get(Calendar.ERA) &&
                cal1.getClass() == cal2.getClass());
    }
this was the original buggy line which was removed by the >>>[INFILL]<<< location:
 cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR) &&
the code fails on this test: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DateUtilsTest::testIsSameLocalTime_Cal
on this test line:
assertFalse("LANG-677", DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal3, cal4));
with the following test error:
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: LANG-677
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.

Example response:

1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the comparison of hours using `Calendar.HOUR`. However, `Calendar.HOUR` represents the 12-hour clock hour whereas `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` represents the 24-hour clock hour. Since the code is aiming to compare the hour component in a manner consistent with the other fields (such as minute, second, millisecond), it should use `Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY` instead.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should ensure that the comparison is done using the 24-hour clock hour (Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) to maintain consistency with the other fields.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) &&
```
<Example end>
The following code contains a buggy line that has been removed:
  private void visitNew(NodeTraversal t, Node n) {
    Node constructor = n.getFirstChild();
    JSType type = getJSType(constructor).restrictByNotNullOrUndefined();
    if (type.isConstructor() || type.isEmptyType() || type.isUnknownType()) {
      FunctionType fnType = type.toMaybeFunctionType();
>>>[INFILL]<<<
        visitParameterList(t, n, fnType);
        ensureTyped(t, n, fnType.getInstanceType());
      } else {
        ensureTyped(t, n);
      }
    } else {
      report(t, n, NOT_A_CONSTRUCTOR);
      ensureTyped(t, n);
    }
  }
This was the original buggy line which was removed by the infill location
      if (fnType != null) {
The code fails on this test:
com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1002
on this test line:
    testTypes(

        "var f = function() {" +
        "  if (A === B) {" +
        "    new B();" +
        "  }" +
        "};");
with the following test error:
java.lang.IllegalStateException
Please provide an analysis of the problem and the expected behaviour of the correct fix, and the correct line at the infill location in the form of Java Markdown code block.


1. Analysis of the problem:
The problem seems to arise from the missing check for the `fnType` being `null` before attempting to use it in the condition. The code is assuming that `fnType` will always have a non-null value, which is not guaranteed. This can lead to a `java.lang.IllegalStateException` when `fnType` is `null`.

2. Expected Behavior of Correct Fix:
The correct fix should include a null check for `fnType` before using it in the condition to prevent the `java.lang.IllegalStateException` from occurring.

3. Correct code at the Infill Location:

```java
if (fnType != null) {
```
